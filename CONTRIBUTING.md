import { SomeIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';

const MyComponent = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic here
  }, []);

  const handleClick = () => {
    // Handler logic here
  };

  return (
    <div className="bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-dark dark:text-light mb-4">
        Title
